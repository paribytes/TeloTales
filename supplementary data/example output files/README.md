## Qmotif Tool Output Files

Example output files generated by the **qmotif** tool are included in the `supplementary_data` directory. These files serve as reference outputs to illustrate the types of data and results produced by the qmotif analysis process.

### Files Included

- **HG00143_log.txt**: 
  
- **HG00143_output.bai**

- **HG00143_output.bam**: Any reads that pass the stage 1 filter will make it into the output BAM file, as long as the region that the read is in allows that type of read. The output BAMs are by default coordinate sorted. 
  
- **HG00143_output.txt**
  
- **HG00143_stage2_coverage.txt**: 
  
- **HG00143_terminal_output.txt**: An additional output example showcasing motif distribution across forward and reverse strands.


### About Qmotif Output

The `qmotif` tool is used for analyzing specific sequence motifs within genomic data, providing insights into motif frequency, location, and distribution. These example files can be used to:

- Verify the expected format of `qmotif` outputs.
- Compare your results with example outputs for consistency.
  
For more details on interpreting `qmotif` output files, refer to the [Qmotif Documentation](link_to_qmotif_documentation).
